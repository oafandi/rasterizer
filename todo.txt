stages of forward rendering pipeline:

1. vertex processing []
    - modeling transformations
    - camera transformations
    - projection transformations

    for modeling transformations, we don't create new vertices, we change the initial ones
    then we copy all vertices for each camera, so that we can apply camera transformation

2. primitive assembly


3. clipping and culling

4. viewport transform

5. rasterization [mapping primitives in screen space to respective pixels]:

6. fragment processing


what is different for wireframe and solid modes?
